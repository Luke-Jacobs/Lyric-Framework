 im still trying to figure out how to tell you i was wrong i cant fill the emptiness inside since youve been gone so is it you or is it me? i know i said things that i didnt mean but you shouldve known me by now you shouldve known me

 if you believed when i said id be better off without you then you never really knew me at all if you believed when i said that i wouldnt be thinking about you you thought you knew the truth but youre wrong youre all that i need just tell me that you still believe

 i cant undo the things that led us to this place but i know theres something more to us than our mistakes so is it you or is it me i know im so blind when we dont agree but you shouldve known me by now 
you shouldve known me cuz youre all that i want dont you even know me at all youre all that i need just tell me that you still believe

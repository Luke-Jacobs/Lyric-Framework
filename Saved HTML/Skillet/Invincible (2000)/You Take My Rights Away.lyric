 
you take my rights away you take control, no stopping you you take my rights away i can take it 
see me let it go you are in control suffer as we grow and we say - we say we dont want to 
holding nothing you take everything youre worth anything at all anything at all 

 
you define me with your identity lose my life in you i can take - ill take what it costs me

 
i saw angels fall down at the glory of the lord and as i raise my hands i see 
i saw angels fall down at the glory of the lord and as i hit the ground i see 
and i fall down afraid and shaking here and i fall down perfectly safe in you 
i saw angels fall down at the glory of the lord the hurt and the broken find rest here 
i saw angels fall down at the beauty of the lord and as i kneeled i cried to know him 
yeah...

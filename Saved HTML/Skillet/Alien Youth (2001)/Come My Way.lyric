 
hundreds come from everywhere just to see your face and touch the healers hand desperate, i push through the crowd if i could touch your clothes i could feel your power 
come my way 
please look and notice me just to release my pain just to know your name 
come my way im out of touch im out of reach ive got the faith to believe am i out of touch or out of reach what would it take for you to walk towards me 
im out of touch, out of reach but im running towards you and its all i believe 
come my way 
just a touch

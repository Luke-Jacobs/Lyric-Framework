 
speak, and my heart starts aching reach, and the numbness dims beat, still my minds uncertain breathe, it begins again 
you are the one real thing you are the one true thing that i know you are the one real thing no matter what the future brings youre the one real thing 
stay, locked within your presence truth, renew in my mind again rest, cuz i know youre faithful and i trust, cuz i know your name 
you are the one real thing you are the one true thing that i know you are the one real thing no matter what the future brings youre the one real thing 
i get down on my knees and i feel your love wash over me one real thing  
speak, and my heart starts aching reach, and the numbness dims beat, still my minds uncertain breathe, it begins again, again... 
you are the one real thing you are the one true thing that i know you are the one real thing you are the one true thing that i know you are the one real thing no matter what the future brings youre the one real thing 
i get down on my knees and i feel your love wash over me one real thing

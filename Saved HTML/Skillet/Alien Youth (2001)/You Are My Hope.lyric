 
times are hard times have changed dont you say but i keep holding on to you its hard to keep the faith alive day to day leaning on the strength ive found in you youre the hope of all the earth 
you are my hope you are my strength youre everything everything i need you are my hope you are my life you are my hope you are my hope 
far beyond what i can see or comprehend etching your eternity in me nations stream and angels sing, "jesus reigns" and every knee bows down youre the hope of all the earth 
you are my hope you are my strength youre everything everything i need you are my hope you are my life you are my hope you are my hope 
carry on and i sing of how you love and i love you now all the times that i start to sink you come and you rescue me you are my hope you are my hope

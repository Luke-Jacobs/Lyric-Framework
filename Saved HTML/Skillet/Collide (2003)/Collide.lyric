 
we have fallen we have fallen again tonight where do we go from here when theyre tearing down our lives? when all they want is when all they want is for us to live in fear how long can we hold on? can we hold on? hold on 
theres something deep inside that keeps my faith alive when all you can do is hide from the fear thats deep inside of you something, something, something something, something, something to hold me close when i dont know theres something deep inside that keeps my faith alive 
we are healing but its killing us inside can we take a chance? when faith and fear collide we can make it step out and take it we cant live feeling so numb how long can we hold on? can we hold on? hold on 
theres something deep inside that keeps my faith alive when all you can do is hide from the fear thats deep inside of you something, something, something something, something, something to hold me close when i dont know theres something deep inside that keeps my faith alive

 
crashing, covered with debris dwelling in my own pity cry like i have not dig like i had not i start to claw gotta get outta here ive got to, gotta get out 
i am, i am, i am on a higher ground you are, you are my cure from the cycle down  
sinking in a sea of self deception never sold so well regret like i have not pain like i dont want i start to claw gotta get outta here ive got to, gotta get out 
i am, i am, i am on a higher ground you are, you are my cure from the cycle down  
down  
im so cold and i wonder howd i make it this long without you pull me out, out from under on the cycle back to you 
i am, i am, i am on a higher ground you are, you are my cure from the cycle down  
down

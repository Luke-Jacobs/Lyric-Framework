 
death until the dust, and were waiting ruined in the rust, of our craving it feels like, it feels like dont you know the cost, of your betrayal? youre the one thats lost, youre gonna fail it feels like, it feels like youre gasping with all your might 
you cant take away my strength fix these broken veins theres nothing left to fight live free or let me die you cant take away my pride, i wont be denied theres nothing left to fight live free or let me die 
insects walk below, im on a wire fire will burn below, but i am higher it feels like, it feels like dont you know the cost, of your betrayal? youre the one thats lost, youre gonna fail it feels like, it feels like youre gasping with all your might 
you cant take away my strength fix these broken veins theres nothing left to fight live free or let me die you cant take away my pride, i wont be denied theres nothing left to fight live free or let me die 
do you remember how you became who you are now? do you remember how it felt to breathe without gasping with all your might? 
you cant take away my strength fix these broken veins nothing left to fight 
you cant take away my strength fix these broken veins theres nothing left to fight live free or let me die you cant take away my pride, i wont be denied theres nothing left to fight nothing left to fight nothing left to fight live free or let me die live free or let me die live free or let me die

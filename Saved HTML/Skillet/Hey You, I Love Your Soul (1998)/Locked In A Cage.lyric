 
i wanna be locked in a cage i wanna be strapped in a chair i wanna be where you are if my insanity comes wrapped up inside you 
i wanna break my legs in case of thought to escape keep the hammer out of my reach if my pounding impulse comes wrapped up inside your arms.... locked up inside you 
hold me down cause i want to know you you bring calm to my rage you are life and im thirsting for you 
hold me, hold me, locked in a cage i love to be caught in you i wanna be trapped in your arms your cage is rest to my bones your cage is peace to my soul wrapped up inside your arms wrapped up inside you 
hold me down cause i want to know you you bring calm to my rage you are life and im thirsting for you hold me, hold me, locked in a cage wrapped up inside your arms wrapped up inside your arms im inside your arms 
im inside your arms hold me down cause i want to know you you bring calm to my rage you are life and im thirsting for you hold me, hold me, locked in a cage

 
jesus pure truth recollect my mind ya-di-da-da-da hurt that i push down shows my anger why i cant go underground 
everything i bury gets exhumed i gotta dig deeper and all the things i bury gets exhumed i gotta dig deeper 
i must get used to strength out if weak ya-di-da-da-da becoming by what i give not by what i can keep 
exposed before you everything i bury gets exhumed i gotta dig deeper and all the things i bury gets exhumed i gotta dig deeper 
how can i hide deeper how can i fly deeper in you 
and everything i bury gets exhumed and all the things i bury gets exhumed

 
talking to god hearing what he wants he moves in violence i stand in silence 
who can question you, who can fathom you? in your presence, who can stand? worlds spin around and kings crumble down theres no escape what youve planned 
winds approaching, clouds are forming god in his power is swirling around me calling me, and you know my name so jump in or be taken, yea i cant run long enough, or go far enough to escape the screaming rain 
its alright its alright jump in the whirlwind im letting go  
my worlds at stake i want to break stop the striving start the dying im thrown into it its so imminent theres no arguing what you say i gotta keep fanning it, i keep fanning it i keep fanning the fire to flames 
its alright its alright jump in the whirlwind im letting go  
master and savior, sustainer and creator you move in power and winds and thunder 
its alright its alright jump in the whirlwind letting go letting go - im letting go

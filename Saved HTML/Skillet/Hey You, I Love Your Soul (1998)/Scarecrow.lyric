 
hanging on this post in my dirty clothes try to concentrate on you but i keep forgetting 
safe enough to not let go scared enough to not release open up to drink the wind you tear me up when you come in 
take me down, shake me out give me a brain, that i might know you better take me down, shake me out give me a brain, that i might know you better 
hanging in the sun waiting for the rain saw a field catch on fire i caught myself just watching 
safe enough to not let go scared enough to not release open up to drink the wind you tear me up when you come in 
take me down, shake me out give me a heart, that i might love you better take me down, shake me out give me a heart, that i might love you better 
hanging on a post just next to yours i want to curse and spit i weep aloud at your mercy 
take me down, shake me out give me a life, that i might serve you better take me down, shake me out give me a life, that i might serve you better

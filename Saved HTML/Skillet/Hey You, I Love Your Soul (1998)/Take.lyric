 
take my strength, take my pride, take my selfishness away take my rights, take ambition, capture me, make me a slave break the walls, break my bones, break my hardened heat rip my rule, rip my will, rip independency apart 
breathe your life, breathe your love, breathe you breath and im sustained 
take my hate, take my hurt, express healing to my pain take my flesh in all its arrogance, my stability away take my life, bring fire, til only you remain 
laid out on my face yea my tongue hanging out to taste yea of you and your death yea and to know your name yea 
accept my gifts, take my crowns, i spread them at your feet when i bleed, i bleed with joy as i taste your suffering flood life, flood peace, speak acceptance to my shame allow to kneel, allow to praise, give the right to speak your name 
laid out on my face yea my tongue hanging out to taste yea of you and your death yea and to know your name yea  
laid out on my face wanting to know your name

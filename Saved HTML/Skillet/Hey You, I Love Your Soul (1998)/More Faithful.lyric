 
all the things my feet thought to be firm are falling with urgency tearing back my false sense of security 
some say things change, nothing stays the same but the sweetness in my ears safe in your arms speak the words i love to hear 
you have been more faithful than the morning sun you have been more faithful than knowing the night will come you have been more faithful than the changing of seasons 
all things i thought that i used to know are falling down again 
our disillusionment is how we grow some say things change, nothing stays the same in a world of inconsistency when everythings a lie, 
what can cause my heart to believe you have been more faithful than the morning sun you have been more faithful than knowing the night will come you have been more faithful than the changing of seasons 
you have been more faithful than the morning sun you have been more faithful than knowing the night will come you have been more faithful than the morning sun you have been more faithful than knowing the night will come you have been more faithful than the changing of seasons

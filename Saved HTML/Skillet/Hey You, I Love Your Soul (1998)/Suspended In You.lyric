 
thought youd put me in a box thought youd push me into a clump make me smaller than i was before though youd press me mold me in took a step and felt the pressure on exploding me into open space 
now you pull me apart im suspended in you stretch me bigger reveal yourself to be the frame that holds me tightly in center pulled into suspension in the middle of you 
let what was hidden be reveal walls of fear broken wide infinite jesus spread all in you towering over the horizons gushing with surrender in your hands 
now you pull me apart im suspended in you stretch me bigger reveal yourself to be the frame that holds me tightly in center pulled into suspension in the middle of you

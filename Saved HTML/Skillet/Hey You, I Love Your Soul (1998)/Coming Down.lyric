 
things are coming down things are coming down i can tell you beautiful the sound of things coming cause i heard him say 
division is coming down i saw peace on a white horse riding love is spreading around the most contagious disease weve ever known 
i will drink from the well of the one who gives me life i will eat of the bread of the one sacrifice i will breathe of the breath of the body of god i will dive to the depths and raise a new man 
racism is coming down not from law but a change in perception revivals spreading around i hear the sound of reapers already say 
i will drink from the well of the one who gives me life i will eat of the bread of the one sacrifice i will breathe of the breath of the body of god i will dive to the depths and raise a new man 
our knees are going down to the one who brings far to my every bone his kingdoms reigning down who can stop the plans of the lord i say 
i will drink from the well of the one who gives me life i will eat of the bread of the one sacrifice i will breathe of the breath of the body of god i will dive to the depths and raise a new man

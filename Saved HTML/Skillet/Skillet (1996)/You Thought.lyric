 
you try to answer slow you put your head down low cmon take your time try to choose the most believable lie 
you try to walk away and tell me everythings okay you think youre are saved by words but youre drowning in the absurd 
but to me its no big surprise you thought i never saw your eyes 
departed with a smile just like walking down the isle you shook the preachers hand but your smile cant hide your sin your eyes tell me what you feel you eyes tell me what is real nobodys perfect is your prediction your life is proving your conviction! 
to me its no big surprise i saw the emptiness in your eyes

 
i stand here closed and open praying for the summer rains reaching in to pull back the curtains ruling in this desolate land 
i will let me go my walls melt away 
you have no boundaries you cross my borders you have no boundaries you crash my borders 
i lie here clothed and naked dam bursts to cool ocean waves black water cleans the highway resting in the washing away 
i will let me go my walls melt away 
you have no boundaries you cross my borders you have no boundaries you crash my borders 
you are more than all that is outside of me you are more than that which is inside of me 
you have no boundaries i have no borders from you you have no boundaries i have no borders

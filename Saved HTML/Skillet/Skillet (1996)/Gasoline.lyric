 
im sitting with my heart out on the table im doing a face to face with god he picked up my heat and said, what you want me to do with this? i just blinked my eyes no smile, no laugh, no tears no shrugging my shoulders 
it crossed my mind, yeah i got an idea you could take my heart and put it in a padlocked box what if they grab too hard or smash it, or throw it down im scared of being hurt, i just want to live, live a happy life! 
you want to, you want to soak my heart in gasoline light a match and consume me soak my pride in gasoline all of you and none of me 
i was reminded my heart reeks of gasoline it bears the mark of a slave committed to life anyone who wants it will have to grab it from a real big god try to touch me, youll be consumed, youll be consumed i want to, i want to 
im sitting here with my heart out on the table next to a bloody mess that was once a mans heart i looked at god and said, what do you want me to do with this? he said, already done, already done, that heart was jesus

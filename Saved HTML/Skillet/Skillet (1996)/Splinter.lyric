 
here i lie again inside this broken body wrestle against the tree, my muscles aching to get up now is death, to die is to really live flesh is restless, twisting, spasms in my back increasing 
splinter me, splinter me my heart, my head splinter me 
here i think again to try to solve this puzzle what is not yours i dont want, my mind aching to reconstruct my thoughts or let it blow away you are all-knowing, changing, yeah youre killing me 
splinter me, splinter me my heart, my head splinter me 
jesus whispered softly, jesus shouted it out his kingdom body coming but we nail him up and hate each other 
splinter me, splinter me my broken body splinter me splinter me, splinter me my broken body splinter me

 
we take a walk in the garden we share the fruits of life we live beneath this canopy why did we take that bite? 
we cover up our shame we walk in black and white we turn this ground for hunger why did we take that bite? 
paint me with an endless sunrise, paint me paint me open eyes, paint me with the color of love 
you took a walk on the planet you gave us shad and light you create mood and substance how can i can take a bite? 
paint me with an endless sunrise, paint me paint me open eyes, paint me with the color of love 
paint me, mark me up, in these frail, dot-to-dot lines color me from one red stream from which all others flow take my black and white and yellow brown and pink and pain and sorrow take my black and white and yellow brown and pink and hate and sorrow 
paint me with an endless sunrise, paint me paint me open eyes, paint me with the color of love

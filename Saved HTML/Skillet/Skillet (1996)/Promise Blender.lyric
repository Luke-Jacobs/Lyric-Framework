 
when i was a young boy i saw a vision of your face i made a my first promise to you yeah ya know it took some time but i love you now i realize 
i am a promise maker i am a promise breaker 
on the road to faithfulness i sometimes forget your name but i can still see your face and time after time i hear you calling my name i gotta name for me, i gotta a name, i gotta name for me, i gotta name 
i am the promise maker i am the promise breaker 
on my knees for the last time i could rip my heart out every day i made my last promise to you yeah i could cry i could cry a million tears a day and all i would hear you say is 
you are the promise taker you are the promise taker you are the promise taker you put them in your promise blender 
you took me, and you own me and you bought me, and you love me promise keeper, keeper, keeper

 
i want to pleasure in your sight i want to subscribe to your delight 
so hold on and see what i do for you oh by the way, did you see me dressed in my beautiful robe? 
my head was bleeding so red but all the thorns in my crown, the rose blended instead with my beautiful robe carries on, ill carry on 
i cut down a tree said, man would you look at me i stuck my head in a thorn bush man i was deceived 
oh my brother, your hands are full of sores but god blessed you brother, my nails are longer than yours i was crucified with christ but how come im not dead god gave me a cross but i made my own instead my beautiful carries on, ill carry on 
i cut down the tree, i nailed myself to the wood i screamed in agony, cause the glory wasnt so good 
i fell to my knees and i remember the words of god pierced so hard, your righteousness is like filthy rags and i fell to my knees and said, my filthy robe

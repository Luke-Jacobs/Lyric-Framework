 
looking on the sad times, the guilt and all the shame i have learned to submit my existing hurts and pains all the grief ive learned to set aside 
cause i am, i am, i am feeling underooted feeling undermined can this grace of god cover me this time? 
when i feel the pain i know why i feel strange when i hear the rooster crow i am ashamed jesus on the cross and this cross upon my back i have learned to submit then i whine about my lack 
sometimes i drop my cross, deserve a little rest thats when i run to you and i nail your feet and your wrist 
im feeling underooted feeling undermined can this grace of god cover me this time? 
do you really love my soul, even after i hated you? do you really know my name, can i really come to you? are you really more faithful than the changing of the seasons and the morning sun? do you really know my name, can i really come to you? i can, i dont care if the rooster crows i can

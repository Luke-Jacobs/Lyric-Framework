 
learning inside i will be safe with you tonight you cause the smile and the teardrops in my eyes locked inside your every movement will i stand or will i fall? trapped inside of your walls of glory i am just as dead leaves fall 
safe with you safe with you 
chaos in my head the whole universe is at rest when im in your arms is when i feel the best locked inside your creative being whirling about your unfailing truth attacked with power by ferocious love salvation alone belongs to you 
safe with you safe with you 
lifting up my voice to the god who really sees the god who is consumed with loving thoughts of me the screaming winds and the crashing of the oceans shifting sands and the changing of the seasons as i stand in awe and wonder nothing in the world has prepared me for you! 
jesus, jesus, im safe with you

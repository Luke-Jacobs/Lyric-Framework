 
youre here, trembling with fear you made it clear you turned your back and now youve gone astray nothing left to say whats standing in your way? you had the chance to never walk alone 
but you gave it all away when i needed you to stay just open up your arms i need you here i can do this on my own i got nothing left to show open up your arms i need you here! 
again, lying in your bed nightmares is in your head facing all that you just threw away at the edge again its coming to an end you had the chance to never walk alone 
but you gave it all away when i needed you to stay just open up your arms i need you here i can do this on my own i got nothing left to show open up your arms i need you i need you, here! here! i need you, here! here! 
you gave it all away i needed you to stay open up your arms i need you 
i can do this on my own i got nothing left to show open up your arms i need you here but you gave it all away when i needed you to stay just open up your arms i need you here i can do this on my own i got nothing left to show open up your arms i need you here!

 
a long day alone emptiness is so real never having peace of mind running from what i cant see and there is nowhere left to hide turn and face these empty eyes all alone, heart untold trying to find 
break me down replace this fear inside take this nothingness from me i want to find i want to shine i want to rise break me down 
i try to find myself i find the stranger trapped inside and ill take one more step away from the face i used to recognize familiar shadows closing in suffocating fear descends it comes alive, uncovered eyes 
im trying to find break me down replace this fear inside take this nothingness from me i want to find i want to shine i want to rise break me down 
replace this fear inside take this nothingness from me i want to find i want to shine i want to rise break me down 
break me down i want to find i want to shine i want to rise break me down  
break me!

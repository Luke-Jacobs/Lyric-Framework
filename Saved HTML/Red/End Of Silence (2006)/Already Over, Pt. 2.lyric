 
you never go youre always here beneath my skin i cannot run away fading slowly 
give it all to you reaching as i fall its already over, already over now 
my best defense, running to you i cant resist, take all you want from me breaking slowly 
give it all to you reaching as i fall its already over now loving you again 
its already over, already over now youre what i reach for when i fall its already over youre what i reach for when i fall its already over now

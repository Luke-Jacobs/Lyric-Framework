 
waste away im crawling blind hollowed by what i left inside for you, just you im caught in place but i ignore what i cant erase 
i will run and hide till memories fade away and i will leave behind a love so strong 
close my eyes theses voices say haunting me, i cant escape for you, just you time will always wait while i throw away what i cant replace 
i will run and hide till memories fade away and i will leave behind a love so strong  
i will run and hide! and i will leave behind! 
i will run and hide till memories fade away and i will leave behind a love so strong!

 
and this is how it feels when i ignore the words you spoke to me and this is where i lose myself when i keep running away from you and this is who i am when, when i dont know myself anymore and this is what i choose when its all left up to me 
breathe your life into me i can feel you im falling, falling faster breathe your life into me i still need you im falling, falling breathe into me breathe into me 
and this is how it looks when i am standing on the edge and this is how i break apart when i finally hit the ground and this is how it hurts when i pretend i dont feel any pain and this is how i disappear when i throw myself away 
breathe your life into me i can feel you im falling, falling faster breathe your life into me i still need you im falling, falling breathe into me breathe into me breathe into me breathe into me 
breathe your life into me i can feel you im falling, falling faster breathe your life into me i still need you im falling, falling breathe into me 
breathe your life into me! im falling, falling faster breathe your life into me! falling, falling, falling breathe into me breathe into me breathe into me breathe into me

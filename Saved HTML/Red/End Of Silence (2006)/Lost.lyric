 
can i be dreaming once again? im reaching helpless i descend you lead me deeper through this maze im not afraid 
im lost in you everywhere i run everywhere i turn im finding something new lost in you, something i cant fight i cannot escape i could spend my life lost in you! lost in you! 
your whispers fill these empty halls im searching for you as you call im racing, chasing after you i need you more 
im lost in you everywhere i run everywhere i turn im finding something new lost in you, something i cant fight i cannot escape i could spend my life lost in you! 
i could never be the same something that i never could erase i could never look away i lost myself in you! its all over now! 
lost in you! everywhere i run lost in you! everywhere i run! lost in you! lost in you!

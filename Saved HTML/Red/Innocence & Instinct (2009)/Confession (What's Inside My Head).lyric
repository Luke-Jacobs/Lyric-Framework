 
i feel fine and i cant smile but i feel the anger coming its underneath i dont know why its always overflowing its a constant fight deep inside and i wanna forget it 
i confess im always afraid always ashamed of whats inside me i confess im always afraid always ashamed of whats inside my head 
and i cant breath and i still feel but not the way i want to im on the edge i dont know how i can escape this nightmare 
i confess im always afraid always ashamed of whats inside me i confess im always afraid, always ashamed of whats inside my head whats inside my head 
wasting away is part of my instinct ill runaway, everything i hate take this away, help me escape take this away i confess, innocence! innocence! innocence!

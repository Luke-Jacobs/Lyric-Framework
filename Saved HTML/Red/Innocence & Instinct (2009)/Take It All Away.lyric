 
youve stripped me down, the layers fall like rain its over now, just innocence and instinct still remain you watched me while i slowly disappeared i reached for you to save me; you were frozen in your fear 
take it all away  
circling the pain inside my soul i reached inside your silence to steal what you wont show i tried to find the answers in my fears but what was found is lost again as soon as it appeared 
take it all away  
im breaking; i cant do this on my own can you hear me screaming out, am i all alone? 
you take away

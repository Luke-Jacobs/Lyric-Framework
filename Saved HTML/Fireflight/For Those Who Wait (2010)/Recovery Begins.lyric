 
i talk, i talk too much
i never open up
to what you need to say
my words get in the way

i search for stillness
but worry kills it
i need to clear my head
im tired, i need to rest

it all comes down to this
the quiet in the end
i listen for your voice
recovery begins

the times i hear you most
are when you bring me close
ill follow as you guide
while darkness turns to light

whisper to me, whisper to me
whisper to me, whisper to me

 
yesterday i heard your voice whispering through all the noise i pretended i couldnt hear you but you kept on pursuing me and you began to move in me and i just couldnt hide any more i wont fight you 
go ahead! take what you want to take what you need to dont let me hold you back go ahead! do what you have to cuz i want to know you dont let me hold you back 
ill my wear heart out on my sleeve if it brings you close to me help me leave the life i knew before you come inside, erase the shame call me by different name i wont be the same anymore god, i trust you 
god, i was so wrong to stay away so long oh, how i need you!

 
i hear the tone in your voice you see that look in my eyes i think youre missing the point you think ive lost my mind 
i dont care who started this  
drop the attitude you dont have to win its not me against you we can start again drop the attitude we dont have to fight we can make it through love can make it right 
i think that we should just stop i think that we need to rewind forgive and live like we forgot we ever drew this line 
i dont care who started this  
drop the attitude you dont have to win its not me against you we can start again drop the attitude we dont have to fight we can make it through love can make it right 
i love you i just do not understand why we do what we do 
drop the attitude you dont have to win its not me against you we can start again drop the attitude we dont have to fight we can make it through love can make it right drop the attitude  love can make it right make it right make it right

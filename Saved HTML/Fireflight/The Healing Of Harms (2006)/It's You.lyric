 
i wish that i could break all the mirrors in my mind the ones that lie to me and steal away my pride i wish i could be blind to everything that haunts me if i use my heart, i can see your face you show me the real me 
its you that i search for it is you i cant live without your hope is what i long for when nothings left in me its you 
this world is always trying to take a piece of me but you are always there to make me feel complete if i can keep my eyes on what you have for me i will face the truth and never look away youll show me the real me 
its you that i search for it is you i cant live without your hope is what i long for when nothings left in me its you 
when i have nowhere else to go and i cant find my way out your light it comes to guide me i cant hide you show me the real 
its you that i search for it is you i cant live without your hope is what i long for when nothings left in me its you

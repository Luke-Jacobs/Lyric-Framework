 
he walks into a crowded room smiles at everyone he sees another night, pretending hes alright cant find what he really needs 
hes looking for something more something new to heal his broken heart hes looking for someone who who can understand 
she sees him there, tries not to star but something stirs her deep inside shell recognize,something in his eyes fight the urge to run and hide and all the while 
shes looking for something more something new to heal her broken heart hes looking for someone who who can understand 
they thought that they were lost but theyve been on their way to the place where love would find them its time to let go of all the pain theyve known and leave the past behind them what is it that has brought them here with faith it can become so clear 
something more something new to heal their broken heart theyre looking for someone who who can understand

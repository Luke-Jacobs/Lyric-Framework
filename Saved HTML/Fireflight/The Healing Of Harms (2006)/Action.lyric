 
so many hurting people without a leg to stand on theyre reaching out every day we all like to stare and we pretend we care how can we keep on doing nothing? 
can anybody hear me? can anybody see me? does anyone really understand? 
were looking for some action we need something to happen no more wasted nights and days were looking for some action 
hey, can you hear them crying? will you refuse to listen? maybe you have no time why would you rather stay where its warm and safe when youve got everything to offer? 
can anybody hear me? can anybody see me? does anyone really understand?

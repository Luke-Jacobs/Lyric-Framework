 
the light behind your eyes tells me that youve cried sometime tonight i offer down my hand but without your plans you cannot hide 
the white snow falls i cannot see on my black heart in front of me say it to me in a way that i can understand i hear you call loud and clear it melts my heart take my fear show me how to see the love that brings serenity 
im pouring out my love open up your hands not big enough you tried to do it all its time for you to fall youve done enough 
the white snow falls i cannot see on my black heart in front of me say it to me in a way that i can understand i hear you call loud and clear it melts my heart take my fear show me how to see the love that brings serenity

 loud and clear, take my fear  
oh my god ive worked so far ive gotten nowhere 
the white snow falls i cannot see on my black heart in front of me say it to me in a way that i can understand i hear you call loud and clear it melts my heart take my fear show me how to see the love that brings serenity

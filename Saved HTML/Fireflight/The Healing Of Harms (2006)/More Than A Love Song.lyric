 
look into her eyes you can see shes crying out she hides behind her smile you can see the pain of doubt and if you would hold her close you could feel the brokenness inside you would know she feels alone she feels empty 
she needs more than a hug on a holiday she needs more than a smile on a sunday shes not looking for you to fix whats wrong she really wants to know really wants to know she belongs she needs more than a love song 
listen to her now broken is a beautiful sound shes a little scared shes afraid of falling further down but maybe if you let her know and gave her just a little hope somehow if she knew the truth shed come alive 
she needs more than a hug on a holiday she needs more than a smile on a sunday shes not looking for you to fix whats wrong she really wants to know really wants to know she belongs she needs more than a love song 
in the end we will learn actions speak louder then our words 
she needs more than a hug on a holiday she needs more than a smile on a sunday shes not looking for you to fix whats wrong she really wants to know really wants to know she belongs she needs more than a love song

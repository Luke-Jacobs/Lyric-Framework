 
i lost my way home looking at myself searching for nothing i knew all along where i belong everyday i stand in the light i can take the stage but you are the one you give me the love 
you know what you are youre the star of the show cuz you are the one i cannot breathe in, without a reason youre the star  
im coming home now closer to you you show me the way you turn me into something thats new 
you know what you are youre the star of the show cuz you are the one i cannot breathe in, without a reason youre the star  
i thought that i knew you but i was only pushing you away now i can hear you ill listen to every word you say 
you know what you are youre the star of the show cuz you are the one i cannot breathe in, without a reason youre the star

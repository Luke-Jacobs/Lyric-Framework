 
terror raining,
down on us.
all is darkness,
choked with dust.
all our world,
lays in a ruin.
endless night,
with no moon.


hear the call to war,
heed the battle cry.
his blood has been spilled,
for our lives.

pinned beneath,
our hopes and dreams.
broken light,
and shattered beams.
futures ended,
hopes deferred.
our worst nightmare,
has occurred

 
im sorry i dont mean to remember its true that i dream less often im not ashamed of that long december your hands coming down again 
i close my eyes and brace myself i only noticed your face no matter what youre gonna build my shell no matter what youre gonna build my shell 
im falling falling im shedding my skin my skin but its not time im told i am aware am aware of what you mean by then im only ten years old 
close my eyes and brace myself only noticed your face no matter what youre gonna build my shell no matter what youre gonna build my shell 
my scars are yours today this story ends so good i love you and i understand that you stood where i stood 
close my eyes and brace myself i only noticed your face no matter what youre gonna break my shell no matter what youre gonna break my shell 
im done healing im done healing

 
here i stand empty hands wishing my wrists were bleeding to stop the pain from the beatings 
and, there you stood holding me waiting for me to notice you 
but who are you you are the truth im screaming these lies you are the truth saving my life 
the warmth of your embrace melts my frostbitten spirit you speak the truth and i hear it the words are i love you and i have to believe in you 
but who are you you are the truth im screaming these lies you are the truth saving my life 
my hands are open and you are filling them hands in the air in the air, in the air, in the air 
and i worship i worship i worship i worship 
you are the truth im screaming these lies

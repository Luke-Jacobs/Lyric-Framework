 
telling laylas story spoken bout how all her bones are broken hammers fall on all the pieces two months in the cover creases 
fully alive more than most ready to smile and love life fully alive and she knows how to believe in futures 
all my complaints shrink to nothing im ashamed of all my somethings shes glad for one day of comfort only because she has suffered 
fully alive more than most ready to smile and love life fully alive and she knows how to believe in futures 
here she stands today in her brilliant shining way stronger than her pain in her brilliant shining way 
fully alive more than most ready to smile and love life fully alive and she knows how to believe in futures 
fully alive more than most ready to smile and love life fully alive and she knows how to believe in jesus

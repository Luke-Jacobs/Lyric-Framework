 
said the night wind to the little lamb do you see what i see way up in the sky, little lamb do you see what i see a star, a star, dancing in the night with a tail as big as a kite with a tail as big as a kite 
said the little lamb to the shepherd boy do you hear what i hear ringing through the sky, shepherd boy do you hear what i hear a song, a song, high above the trees with a voice as big as the sea with a voice as big as the sea 
said the shepherd boy to the mighty king do you know what i know in your palace warm, mighty king do you know what i know a child, a child, shivers in the cold let us bring him silver and gold let us bring him silver and gold 
said the king to the people everywhere listen to what i say pray for peace people everywhere listen to what i say a child, a child, sleeping in the night he will bring us goodness and light he will bring us goodness and light he will bring us goodness and light

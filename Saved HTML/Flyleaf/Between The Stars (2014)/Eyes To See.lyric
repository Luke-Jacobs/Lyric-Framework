 
i want you to know that i see all the reasons why you fail ive seen all your motivations ones for good and ones for hell 
when you close your eyes to see the truth thats inside me may you hold your breath to breathe your empty reality 
if you had eyes to see down inside your stomach then you would understand what i mean who i am who i am 
i was pouring out of passion to light the step youre on you choose not to hear or waken all thats left is you alone 
when you close your eyes to see the truth thats inside me may you hold your breath to breathe your empty reality 
if you had eyes to see down inside your stomach then you would understand what i mean who i am who i am 
you cant limit me with all your gross mistakes 
if you had eyes to see down inside your stomach then you would understand what i mean who i am who i am

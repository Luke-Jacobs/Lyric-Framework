 
so many wasted days come and go like ocean waves it hits me like a freight train and now i cant get off my face 
how could i have been so polite to simply let them die who am i to spread my fingers after god has filled my hands watching the moments slip through like desert sand 
respect her ignorance just in case she takes offense the darkness thats killing her well that is just not my concern 
how could i have been so polite to simply let them die who am i to spread my fingers after god has filled my hands watching the moments slip through like desert sand 
youre not guaranteed tomorrow youre not guaranteed tomorrow 
how could i have been so polite to simply let them die who am i to spread my fingers after god has filled my hands watching the moments slip through like desert sand

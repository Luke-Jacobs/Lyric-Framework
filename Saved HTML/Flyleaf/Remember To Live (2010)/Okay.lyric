 
i wont be satisfied with okay and i cant be okay with alright so point me to the edge of life ill stand up on my toes stretch my fingers out to there and bring it back here 
its too important for us to forget well unify our thoughts god will hear and save god will hear and save us 
all together standing up on our toes reaching for the freedom that they dont know so catch it as it pours down we know what we need dont get tired when youre running back to show them 
its too important for us to forget well unify our thoughts god will hear and save god will hear and save us
 
i wont be satisfied with okay and i cant be okay with alright so point me to the edge of life ill stand up on my toes stretch my fingers out to there and bring it back here

 
pour the wine light revives lowering walls that divide kings and queens yearn to seek love in all its mystery 
when all we wanted was love, we got cut up and burned but theres a light in your eyes and it tells me that god is on our side 
the waning moon your sweet perfume incense for the holy ones secret hymns pour from your lips healing for this broken soul 
wed drive late and let the music tell our fate for me this is heaven drown our fears and we may age if we do not die today until then well let this music be our prayers 
when all we wanted was love, we got cut up and burned but theres a light in your eyes and it tells me that god is on our side 
and all we need now is love weve been through enough we cant run just cause were scared weve come this far were not giving up all we need now is love weve been through enough we cant run just cause were scared weve come this far were not giving up 
and all we need now is love weve been through enough we cant run just cause were scared weve come this far were not giving up and all we need now is love weve been through enough we cant run just cause were scared weve come this far were not giving up

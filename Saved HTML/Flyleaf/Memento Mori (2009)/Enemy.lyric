 
i have made you an enemy
i have been my own enemy
i am asking for you to forgive me
for everything

if you dont
youre worthy of compassion
if you do
youre a better man than i am

if you dont know, youre my family
enemy
im sorry
oh, enemy, family
forgive me

if you dont
youre worthy of compassion
if you do
youre a better man than i am
if you do
youre a better man than i am

enemy, enemy, family, family

 
green light, seven eleven you stop in for a pack of cigarettes, you dont smoke, dont even want to, hey now, check your change dressed up like a car crash the wheels are turning but your upside down you say when he hits you, you dont mind because when he hurts you, you feel alive oh, is that what it is 
red lights, gray morning you stumble out on a whole in the ground a vampire? or a victim? it depends on whose around you used to stay up to watch the adverse, you could to lip sing to the talk shows. and if you look, you look through me, and when you talked, its not to me and when i touch you, you dont feel a thing 
if i could stay, then a night would give you up stay, and the day would keep its trust stay, and the night would be alive far away, so close up with the static on the radio with satellite, television you can go any where miami, new orleans, london, belfast, and berlin 
and if you listen i can call and if you jump, you just might fall and if you shout ill only hear you 
if i could stay, then a night would give you up stay, and the day would keep its trust stay, with the demons you drowned stay, with the spirit i found stay, and the night would be alive. ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh three o clock in the morning its quiet and theres no one around. just a bang and a clatter, as angel runs to ground. just a bang and a clatter, as angel hits the ground.

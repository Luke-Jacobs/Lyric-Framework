 
im so glad to be here this day has become sacred im trembling with thankfulness for all of this 
who am i who am i that you have brought me this far, this far who am i that you have brought me so far 
all those years of spoiled complaining i said its not enough and you have forgiven me for everything everything and you have given me everything oh its too much, its too much youre too much, youre too much 
who am i who am i that you have brought me this far, this far who am i that you have brought me so far 
who am i who am i that you have brought me this far, this far who am i that you have brought me so far

 
when i said good morning i was lying i was truly thinking of how i might quit waking up 
he pointed out how selfish it would be to kill myself so i keep waking up 
it feels so much like falling dying while i wait to die the fear of something or nothing lonely empty lie 
i dont want to be here, lying i dont want to be selfish anymore i want so much to change learning your love everyday theres still so much to know 
you grip my wrists i let go 
it feels so much like falling separated from the fear aware of a destination far away from here 
it feels so much like falling separated from the fear aware of a destination far away from here far away from here

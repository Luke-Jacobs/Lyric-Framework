 
tinas eyes are clear chrysolite how can we not notice her now they only stare at her burns her small voice so full of honesty 
take care of my loves i cant hold on keep me alive while i die 
they cant not notice her sickness like their own dung sprayed with perfume they try not to hear her speaking but they cant hear anything else 
take care of my loves i cant hold on keep me alive while i die 
i missed my chance send one more im not wasting this i missed my chance send one more chance im not wasting this one more chance

 
we cant be oblivious we are not ignorant 
blood in our hearts blood on our hands 
were human we reason were breathing protecting youre living and dying, surviving, were trying to breathe in safety come home safely 
mercy screams its violent love justice.. and mercy justice.. and mercy the death of us created for justice.. and mercy justice.. and mercy this is where they kiss 
life, here sacrificed someone who payed the price blood in our hearts blood on our hands we cry out, were fighting, its warfare, were dying believing were winning, its ending, were singing its already done weve overcome 
mercy screams its violent love justice.. and mercy justice.. and mercy the death of us created for justice.. and mercy justice.. and mercy this is where they kiss 
with a life on the line the fire.. that consumes or refines the fire.. to ascend or decline to retreat or to climb out of sight, out of mind til attacked from behind will this fire.. consume or refine? 
mercy screams its violent love justice.. and mercy justice.. and mercy the death of us created for justice.. and mercy justice.. and mercy this is where they kiss

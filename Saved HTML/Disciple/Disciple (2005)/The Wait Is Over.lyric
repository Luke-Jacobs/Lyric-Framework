 
i can feel it in the thunder rolling, lightning crashing its our time, the wait is over fires burning, floods are rising its our time, the wait is over 
sitting in ashes, were broken, with our faces downward, like theres nothing we are looking forward to 
weve been waiting so long for this moment all of our lives let it pour out 
i can feel it in the thunder rolling, lightning crashing its our time, the wait is over fires burning, floods are rising its our time, the wait is over 
hoping and praying in silence, that the blessings of the former isnt the end of what we look forward to 
weve been waiting so long for this moment all of our lives let it pour out

 
here comes your empty talking empty words and empty soul here comes the smile appearing every time you see me fall break me 
i feel the poison cutting through me spreads like a cancer all over me could it be that youre so insecure that you have to curse me? 
go ahead with all you got try to break me down do you think you can hurt me? all the pain you inflict will make me stronger 
you lie in wait, you analyze youre looking down on me you try to take me down down to your level but you dont change

 
backstabber you liar, betrayer i shouldve known youd be just like your father 
i know he hurt you but thats no excuse to hurt anything and everything that touches you 
what more could you want? i was not enough and that was evident by the fact that you lied to me and cheated, repeatedly you never loved me 
i hoped in you, i believed in you, id forgiven you its all for nothing everything i knew is dead i wont let you in again 
today is the first day of the rest of my life i fell the new come in as i shed my skin today is the first day of the rest of my life i stand on broken chains that held this bitter slave 
coldhearted, you hater love me now, so you leave me later deceiver, so clever jezebel couldnt do much better 
i have nothing to remember you by cause the only thing you gave to me was 
god is this what i put you through in my unfaithfulness to you?

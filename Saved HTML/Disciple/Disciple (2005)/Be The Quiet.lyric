all the fingers point to you im reaching out my hand to you if you wont let me therell be no one to save you this time 
will you let me be the quiet in the storm that you created? will you let me be the quiet in the storm that you created? 
why do you rush into the raging of the ocean that drowns you? its breaking, destroying, what is around you, im pleading

 
i will live and for you only 
you were the only one that i could turn to you were the only one that could ever calm my sea that separated me from what you knew i could be only you 
and through it all im yours alone 
i will live and die for you only only you i will die to live for you only 
you will be the one i will call by name even when i find myself on either side of pain you will be the reason for the breath i breathe only you 
take this burning heart that burns for you make it what you want break it, mend it, it is yours alone for you i will live and die

 
looking in this abandoned place searching in someone elses face dont know what it is but i ill know when i find it 
as i inhale this paradise five minutes of escape dont know what it does but ill know when it does it 
every one of us is looking in a place where peace wont find us there every one of us is wanting something amazing thats in between the living and the dying all we have is now 
give us some meaning while we live some purpose to die all we have is now give us some meaning while we live some purpose to die all we have is now 
maybe in someone elses arms she could complete this broken form dont know what shell do but ill know when she does it 
or i will lift up this desperate prayer if it could find more than open air dont know what hell do but ill know when he does it

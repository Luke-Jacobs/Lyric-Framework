 
its worth it all if i can just see you, feel you its worth it all if theres just one that sees you, feels you i know it will be worth it all 
all the time its taken to be here in this place the scars have left their mark but im still running 
forgetting what is behind im moving straight ahead and i will run with a passion till i reach the end i wont let my eyes move left to right ill run with all my heart, ill give it all i got 
its worth it all if i can just see you, feel you its worth it all if theres just one that sees you, feels you i know it will be worth it all 
remembering all those voices arrows that cut me down theres something burning in me that keeps me running i know it will be worth it all

 
tomorrow may never come an everyday possible prophecy if im hated or if im adored i will not question you here with me 
this solemn truth i will depend on that you could never even think of failing 
when all others start to fade away into black i wont worry, i know you are with me when the sky is falling down on me and turns me back i wont worry, i know you are with me 
i have nothing inside this world but everything that i needs in you if for better or if for worse always and forever i am yours 
you cant hold me back now when its all coming down i know ill be brought out this cant hold me back much longer

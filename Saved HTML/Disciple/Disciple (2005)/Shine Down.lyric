 
destiny questioning the connection with some divinity is there something for me? im stretching out my faith 
i have tasted all the things this world has offered me it has left me thirsty for something this world cannot see 
shine down on me if youre the one who loved me before the stars were made shine down on me if youre the one who gave it all to dethrone my shame 
im empty all of my successes have left with depravity now that all else has failed im stretching out my faith 
at the pinnacle it was impossible to see in the deepest of this darkness it comes clear to me

 
i will not stand silently by as you mock and curse my god stand against him; you will be brought down 
here i come; im bout to rise up all of my people, were bout to rise up here we come now, were bout to rise up all of my people, were bout rise up 
you bark accusations that paralyze my brothers in fear only a small spark starts an unquenchable fire

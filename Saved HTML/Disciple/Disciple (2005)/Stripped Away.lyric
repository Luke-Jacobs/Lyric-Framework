 
i dont want to feel like i cant trust you consequently be the last one i turn to denial doesnt need to be my friend when im a healer thats in need of healing 
is it okay to not know not have the answers and simply be someone who is searching for someone to save me 
youre the only one that sees the only thing inside of me 
when its all stripped away hidden underneath the clay i am simply someone searching for you to save me 
its hard for me to stand upon this pedestal when the light reveals it is a tainted angel it seems that honesty has finally got me to confess i cant save anything

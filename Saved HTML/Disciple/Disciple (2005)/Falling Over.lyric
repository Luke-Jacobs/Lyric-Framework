 
could it be that i am just a product of my own selfishness? could it be that i am just a model that no one should follow? 
couldnt take your word as it was given predestined to wander so im here to reflect and to ponder where ive gone - i miss you 
replace this weight i feel break this heart until i feel you breathing im falling over you 
hearing this voice again all across my skin i feel you breathing im falling over you again falling over you again 
my reasons are gone you knew all along that i would be falling over you again without you it felt wrong it wouldnt be long till i would be falling over you again 
can i go back to when it was just us? i could care less what life brought to us i never will understand why i left this when i felt more, i trusted you 
i knew this was wrong but i needed to be on my own now its been so long since my freedom is me bound to you

 
guess im filled with the christmas spirit celebrate a jolly man in red hope my kids dont find out santa clause isnt real maybe i should have told them about jesus instead 
last time i heard about it he didnt come in a santa outfit santa clause is dead! 
guess its time to thank the easter bunny again for doing absolutely nothing in my life what the heck do a bunch of colored eggs have to do with the son of god being raised back to life 
last time i heard about it he didnt rise in an easter outfit the easter bunny is dead! 
christmas is when i celebrate jesus birth easters when i celebrate jesus resurrection jesus is alive!

 
take my eyes from me, so i will see in spirit change my mind to think, on what you see fit the heavens declare your glory, but does my witness may you be glorified in me, lord may i be blameless

 fall on me 
i am available to do your will, in my life i pray your word is fulfilled, theyre singing honor to you oh lord my god, power and strength to you oh christ jesus

 
when i was poor you had made me a rich man what i was sick you had made me a healed man when i was weak you had made me strong when i was dead you had made me alive

 
oh god, ive done it again you stare me in the eyes and i look away you come around my house and im not home 
and if i had a dollar for every time i sinned against you well id be a rich man 
why are you still here when i told you to leave? why do the oceans never get past my knees? 
you lift me out of the water every time i loose away from you you made me a rich man 
and if i had a dollar for every time i sinned against you well id be a rich man 
you lift me out of the water every time i loose away from you you made me a rich man

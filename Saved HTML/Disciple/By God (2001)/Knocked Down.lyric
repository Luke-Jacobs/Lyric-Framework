 
i know im not the only one who ever sins and makes mistakes but it seems like im the only one who says im sorry forgive me what is it about those words that make it foreign to your mouth i guess sometimes its just too hard to love your neighbor as yourself 
lord can you help me ive been knocked down by the words of a friend give me the power to forgive and love my neighbor as myself youve been through what ive been through you know the kiss of a friend you proved to me on the cross that you loved me as yourself 
you know that i know there is no freedom when we speak theres something in between us that makes us both act differently you try to act like nothings wrong that the problem will just handle itself god screams dont let the sun go down before you love your neighbor as yourself 
lord can you help me ive been knocked down by the words of a friend give me the power to forgive and love my neighbor as myself youve been through what ive been through you know the kiss of a friend you proved to me on the cross that you loved me as yourself 
i gotta get my life in line with you and remove the plank from my eye gotta see with the eyes of love you give so ill love my neighbor as myself

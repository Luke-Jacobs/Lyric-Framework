 
i am the fear who doesnt cower seeking whom i may devour seeking out a girl or a boy to steal and kill and destroy do you even know my name? youre so pathetic and lame and before this day is through i know ill get to you 
i hate you, i hate you you cant hide from me and he cant help you 
i am and i have been and ill always be your enemy i am your dream come true your nightmare hanging in a tree your suicide, your wasted life your lust for flesh all belongs to me 
i hate your guts, you little punk dont come around here selling your junk i know one whos bigger than all your fright a weenie dog has more bite youre a maggot, a pain in the neck a little scratch upon my back and i laugh at the day when you burn in hell forever in your jail 
i hate you, i hate you you cant get to me hes already saved me 
you dont deserve and you wont get no glory in this song all power, glory, blessing and honor belongs to our god we lift you up, we magnify we thank you lord for giving us life 
you dont deserve and you wont get no glory in this song all power, glory, blessing and honor belongs to our god we lift you up, we magnify we thank you lord for giving us life

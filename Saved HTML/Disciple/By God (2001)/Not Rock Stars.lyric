 
servants of the most high 
i am just a man with as many problems as anyone who has lived and i have faced temptations some i pass and some i fail i know what its like to be on the mountain and in the deep abyss and i know what its like to be rescued from the stronghold of hell when i have not humbled myself god has humbled me and im so far from knowing it all cause hes still teaching me but i want to share the love he gave so we all could be not of this world not of this world servants of the most high, not rock stars new creatures in christ, not rock stars  we are meant to be examples and not idols to be praised we are just one of the many parts of the body of god were not here for our own glory were not here to steal from you but our prayer from our heart is that youll find god and see the truth there is something greater than anything that money can buy the privilege and the honor to preach the gospel of jesus christ and we want to share the love he gave so we all could be not of this world not of this world 
servants of the most high, not rock stars new creatures in christ, not rock stars  servants of the most high, not rock stars new creatures in christ, not rock stars

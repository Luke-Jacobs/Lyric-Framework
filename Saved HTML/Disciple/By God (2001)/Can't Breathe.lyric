 
as i lie here thinking cant think of one good reason for what ive done to you ive seen both sides i know the pain of being alone and i have to confess this to you that i cant move and i cant breathe i cant love and i cant speak i cant trust and i cant run i cant wake and i cant sleep i cant live my life without you you hear my voice cry take my heart and hold it in your arms i give you my life set in the potters hands make it what you want cause i cant move and i cant breathe i cant love and i cant speak i cant trust and i cant run i cant wake and i cant sleep i cant live my life without you 
i cant feel and i cant know i cant think and i cant show i cant give and i cant touch i cant sink or rise above i cant live my life without you 
cause i cant move and i cant breathe i cant love and i cant speak i cant trust and i cant run i cant wake and i cant sleep i cant live my life without you, you 
i cant feel and i cant know i cant think and i cant show i cant give and i cant touch i cant sink or rise above i cant live my life without you 
cant live without you

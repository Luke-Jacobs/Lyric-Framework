 
if i trust myself, and in my strength ill be in the desert with nothing to drink ill live in the wilderness, so far and so alone and i wont help myself, so hot and yet so cold i choose not to lean on my own understanding i acknowledge you in my ways and you direct me ill be like a tree by the river when i put my trust in you ill be like a coal in the fire when i put my hope in you if my heart departs and i turn away then i will be cursed from the absence of my faith lord without your help im drowning in the sea and i wont help myself, i cant move and i cant breathe 
i choose not to lean on my own understanding i acknowledge you in my ways and you direct me ill be like a tree by the river when i put my trust in you ill be like a coal in the fire when i put my hope in you 
i choose not to lean on my own understanding i acknowledge you in my ways and you direct me ill be like a tree by the river when i put my trust in you ill be like a coal in the fire when i put my hope in you

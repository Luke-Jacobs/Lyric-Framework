 
as the sun comes up, lord i see you as the wind blows on my face, lord i feel you  sometimes i dont know what to say when my heart wants to praise and i have concluded of you that i barely know anything about you at all cause lord if you showed me a thousand things brand new about you everyday i still would never see the fullness of your glory lord if you gave me a thousand years to try and count up all the ways that you have shown to me that you are just not enough you are too much as the river flows, lord i hear you as the rain falls on face, lord i feel you

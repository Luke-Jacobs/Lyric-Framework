 
you breathe right through me i act like i dont care wondering if everything i do will make you stop and stare if only your eyes could see me a pity i dont get my way we need to be thankful for living another day why cant i be? feel sorry for me im accident prone just leave me alone theres a lazy man that sits in the house with his head propped back and his feet kicked out i lay around and whine all the night while im letting my life just pass me by lord forgive the way that i am and i need you to help to stand help me up and make me be strong and i will praise you all life long excuse me for living i dont mean to complain i know that you dont have anything quite like my pain you see me driving im riding in my car you know that you cant see because it dont go that far 
why cant i be? feel sorry for me im accident prone just leave me alone theres a lazy man that sits in the house with his head propped back and his feet kicked out i lay around and whine all the night while im letting my life just pass me by lord forgive the way that i am and i need you to help to stand help me up and make me be strong and i will praise you all life long 
i want, i need  
i want to be with you i need to talk with you i want to kiss your face i need to be embraced  
why cant i be? feel sorry for me im accident prone just leave me alone theres a lazy man that sits in the house with his head propped back and his feet kicked out i lay around and whine all the night while im letting my life just pass me by lord forgive the way that i am and i need you to help to stand help me up and make me be strong and i will praise you all life long

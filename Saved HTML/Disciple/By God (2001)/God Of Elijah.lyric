 
bring on the show down how long will you waver between two opinions if the lord is god then follow him but if baal is god then follow him there are 450 prophets of baal and just one of me so it should be no problem to get his attention and show everyone here today that if hes the real god hell have to send fire down so they began to shout, run around, cut themselves baal made no reply, so elijah cried maybe hes sleeping, or busy or traveling or using the bathroom, or deeply thinking god of elijah, send your fire let it burn up inside me, melt me down  
god of elijah so elijah took twelve stones representing the twelve tribes and built an altar of sacrifice and dug up a trench and cut up a bull and placed it on the wood and poured four jars of water all around he said do it again and then do it a third until the whole sacrifice had been soaked down water rolled out of the trenches, and elijah prayed lord god of israel let it be known today that you are god and i pray you answer and turn their hearts back to you again let the fire fall and burn it all let it rain down 
god of elijah, send your fire let it burn up inside me, melt me down  
god of elijah, god of elijah 
lord god of israel let it be known today that you are god and i pray you answer and turn our hearts back to you again let the fire fall, burn it all let it rain down 
god of elijah, send your fire let it burn up inside me, melt me down  
god of elijah, god of elijah

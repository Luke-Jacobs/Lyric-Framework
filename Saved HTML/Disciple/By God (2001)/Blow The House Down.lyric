 
parched and dry and lonely my eyes are on me only i forgot what you had told me i built my house upon the sand and i heard your voice so clear a soft whisper in my ear to preach the word of god so all the lost could hear but i am so scared im afraid that i will fail i follow my own path and set my feet upon the sand i worked so hard to build this house i built it up with my two hands i worked my way up to the top so i could be the best man so what if my life is just a lie i am just trying to provide for me and mostly just myself and thats how ill live until i die so let the wind come so let the rain come and blow the house down with a foundation of sand  im so blessed and happy for i know the lord has called me i remember the words he told me i built my house upon the rock and i hear you cry out love to change my heart and soul peace i cannot understand when i cry out to my lord just to hear your voice and know youre guiding me never stop speaking to me let me know your every command 
you worked so hard to build this house built it up with your two hands i worked my way onto my face because i am a thankful man so what if somehow i have to die i know my life is not a lie cause you have my every breath and i know this house aint coming down so let the wind come so let the rain come you cant blow the house down with a foundation of god  
you cant blow the house down  
so let the wind come so let the rain come you cant blow the house down with a foundation of god

 
i dont want to lose my taste my light has gone 
theres a great big city sitting on the hill that will not be hidden and the itty bitty light sitting in the dark is on its lamp stand i dont ever want to lose your call or for my city to ever fall i want my light to always know that its not sitting underneath the bowl i know the greatest man i know my biggest fan i know the best friend i know the great i am i know him gonna let my light shine  please dont let me be open my eyes to see 
the salt that has lost its flavor is salty no more and the paint that has no color is thrown out the door 
i dont ever want to lose your call or for my city to ever fall i want my light to always know that its not sitting underneath the bowl i know the greatest man i know my biggest fan i know the best friend i know the great i am i know him gonna let my light shine

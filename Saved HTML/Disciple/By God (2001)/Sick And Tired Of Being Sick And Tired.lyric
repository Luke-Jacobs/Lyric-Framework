on my knees i need you i did not mean to leave you all my heart receives you it was me its not you restore me, strengthen me im sick and tired, of sick and weak i decrease, you increase heal me of this disease 
my heart is thin, sin creeps in i know you see the pride in me my mind is gone, i can not think i have not prayed for weeks and weeks 
so i wake up and i feel that there is nothing real i havent heard your voice in so long and i know this drought is probably not your fault im so weak and thirsty 
on my knees i need you i did not mean to leave you all my heart receives you it was me its not you restore me, strengthen me im sick and tired, of sick and weak i decrease, you increase heal me of this disease 
on my knees i need you i did not mean to leave you all my heart receives you it was me its not you restore me, strengthen me im sick and tired, of sick and weak i decrease, you increase heal me of this disease

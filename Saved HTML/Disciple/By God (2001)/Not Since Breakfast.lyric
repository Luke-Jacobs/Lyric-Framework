 
after forty times of hitting snooze i slip on the shirt and grab my shoes i head to work to pay my dues just another week of the same old stuff work my fingers all the way to the bone im polite to customers on the phone my bodys working but my mind is gone i just cant wait to get home 
and shut the door grab a praise cd and turn it up take the phone off the hook and turn the light off lay down lay my head back and clear my thoughts hey god its me 
ive been waiting for this time all day long so that we could be all alone to worship you with my heart, my soul, and my mind and leave it all behind 
separate all my laundry clothes repaired the hole in the vacuum hose wiped the grime off the toilet bowl gotta do the dishes before i mow then do three sets of eight on chest cause i gotta keep my shape in check everything else i do will have to wait cause i got a very important date 
shut the door grab a praise cd and turn it up take the phone off the hook and turn the light off lay down lay my head back and clear my thoughts hey god its me 
ive been waiting for this time all day long so that we could be all alone to worship you with my heart, my soul, and my mind and leave it all behind

 
jesus, mystery
how you make things great from small.
take all thats left of me,
in your hands.

steal me away from the chaos of my disarray

remake,
let your oceans crash on me.
remake,
let my mountains drown in your sea.
remake

jesus cover me,
with the beauty i have not.
let the clay of my world spin,
through your hands.

steal me away from the chaos of my disarray.

remake,
let your oceans crash on me.
remake,
let my mountains drown in your sea.

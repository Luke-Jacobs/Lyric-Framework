 the light at the end has faded away one terror after another somewhere in the fire the embers of faith will burn through tomorrow youre breathing

 its worth the pain gods in the rain its not too late to start again its worth the pain so hold on tonight

 your passionate eyes try to explain all the blindness youre feeling the six feet of lies exposed in his fire resurrecting your sunrise youre breathing

 theres grace when youre at your wits end begging for it hell take you by the hand theres grace

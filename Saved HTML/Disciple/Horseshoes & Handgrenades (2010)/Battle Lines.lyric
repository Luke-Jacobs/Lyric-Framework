 just a taste and your eyes will be opened gonna see everything like a god tonight  you keep saying this over and over were no longer slaves that you victimize  
we came here to fight 

 we wont just lay our weapons down  to your demands we wont be swayed so easily thrown by your wind  these battle lines were drawn since the beginning  nothing left to decide theres nothing left to decide 

 even if his hand doesnt save us we will never bow our face tonight  since the second adam has rescued well be looking to raise up when we die

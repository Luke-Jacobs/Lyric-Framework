 
what if the whole world got on their feet and began to cheer for me 
id be a puppet on a string spinning all around your stage
would i seek applause and praise from men in everything i wanted to be 
i dont give a rats rear end what they say as long as my gods happy 
if i never please anyone i please you jesus 
i watch the curtain open up as i stand in front of my only audience 
lord i pray that everything i do will bring a smile to your beautiful face 
help me to be faithful in all i do that i might bring glory to your name

 
what makes you different from one another why do you argue about who you follow there is no man that you belong to theres only one god that can claim you  
i dont care if you dont speak in tongues  i dont care if youre into submersion  what does it matter if wear a liturgical robe or prophesy and say god said so  
i just know jesus is the way i just know jesus is the truth i just know jesus is the life i know that jesus is my god  
do you serve your name or do you serve mankind would you feel the same if they took down your sign could you sit next to me if i was baptist or presbyterian or do i need to be a charismatic or episcopalian  
i dont care if you drink grape juice or if its wine  and i dont care if you get out of church on time what does it matter if you praise god with music in your church  or you burn your dead or bury them six feet in the dirt 
i dont care if you clap your hands  i dont care if you get out in the aisle and dance  whats it matter if someone lets out a hallelujah shout  have we forgotten what praising yahweh is all about

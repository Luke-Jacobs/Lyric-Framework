 
i know your heart and you mean well sometimes you dont care how i feel all the stories i can tell how you make me feel like im in hell 
i know if i could id really love to let it go  i know that i should turn my cheek for another blow  i should do good when you do me bad  all the forgiveness that my saviour had  
i feel like dying when you curse me up one end and down another  i get disgusted when the way you kill me seems so subtle you left me crying in a mud puddle 
i see the anger in your eyes my every action you despise just to win the argument you hit me square below my belt 
i will repay evil with good  i will release my bitterness  i give you my forgiveness  i hope you liked my flowers

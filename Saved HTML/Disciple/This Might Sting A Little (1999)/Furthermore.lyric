 
youre not listening to me, you dont hear a word say you dont understand the message i bring, you dont know the truth  heres an idea ill just throw it at you lets say the sweetest man in all existence was brutalized so you could be with him marred more than any man, humiliated in public  youd think thats enough but is it, but is it? 
lets pretend all you had to do was ask him in  how much easier could that possibly be?  you wouldnt have to sacrifice your pet rhinoceros every time you sinned every time you sinned  
i could tell you if a man were to do that for me id have to lay in his arms to get closer to see the one who is, one who was, and that is to be  but im too lazy to get on my knees 
bring me closer jesus  never let me go  mark your name on me  so i will always know that i feel, i feel you here  
anyway what was i talking about i can not leave and i cant figure out my soul is bloody my tears are gain  i need your fire send down the rain  pour the blood of jesus over me  i need your jesus

 
they wrap me up for comfort when behind my back they stab little old man creeping up again id like to smack him up side his head  
i dont need you i dont care what you say takes me nowhere 
pony wants to ride, supposed to ride him eating from the cat bowl on the outside looking in intoxicating fragrance filling up my nose where it stops nobody knows 
i beat my chest i beat my chest  
words come out so easily but i cant even show it  is a sin really sin when i dont even know it?  
free set my heart free  break, break the chain thats over me  
why do i do the things i dont want to  who will save me from this death  thanks be to god its jesus

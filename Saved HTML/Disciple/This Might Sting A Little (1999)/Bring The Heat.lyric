 
give me release i need a peace  stop the disease the spirit sees 
i need a touch hurts so much give me a hand hit me lord now  
i dont want speak a word without your anointing  i dont want to take a step without you in front  i dont want to hear a voice unless it belongs to you  i don t want to make a choice that you dont want me to  
bring it to me bring the heat bring it to me, bring the heat  
open my eyes  see my disguise i realize its what i despise  give it to you my will is through im gonna do what you want me to now

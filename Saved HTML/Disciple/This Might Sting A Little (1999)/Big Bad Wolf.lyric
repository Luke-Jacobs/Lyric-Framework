 
touch hurts feel pain pierce me open shame 
hate me ive never been hated by anyone just quite like that you do so full of lies as you despise my breath  i hate you for all youve done to me and my family vengeance belongs to god youre underneath his feet 
lord hes coming after me save me  
i knocked he opened up and ran right in now the big bad wolf will never  steal out of the hand of god almighty the life that i gave to him  gone is the sin that enslaved me to this world of darkness because  i knocked he opened up and i ran right in now the big bad wolf will never get me again 
hold out in my face tempt me your blame  
hate me i never been hated by anyone just quite like that you do you always stand and accuse me to my face  hate you for the things that you have stole from me  vengeance belongs to god youll pay back sevenfold  
come and get me you cant get to me blood is over me you cant get to me  underneath his wings  in the secret place

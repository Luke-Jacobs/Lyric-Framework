 
the bodys failing, and my heart is breaking hell is awakened, the souls its taking were taking back where they belong you cannot make us stop youll never make us stop its not about the songs, its about our god 
who will stand and rise against injustice? take up the cause of the unwanted ones? who will stand to fight against us? 
we live, we fight we live, we die we fight for love 
church windows breaking from people living outside the walls the bride must be ready for jesus imminent return

 
when the lights go up and the game is on are you ready for me? cause im ready for you when the bell rings out and the fight is on are you ready for me? cause im ready for you 
its time for us to start throwing down take a look and see whos standing now 
didnt even know that you and i were cross until a sneak attack from the weak side unaware that we were in a fight i guess thats part of the problem, but guess what 
say what you want to say about me throw up what you want to throw up at me but when you mess with those that are around me thats when you and i will have a problem 
im not afraid of loving my enemies turning the other cheek blessing those that would curse me i honestly want peace with you but when you come against my country when you come against my family you try to destroy my people i cant just stand by theres no way that i can stand by this time, i will not stand by i am coming, and if i come, then pain is coming with me im coming, and pain will be with me

 
build it up, ill tear it down my finger in the strings connected to your hands i dance the mockery, a theme of decadence now i am sinking in this violence this time, emancipation is my right 
this is what i want, for you to die this is what i want, to be alive 
scene of complacency, an apathetic mind but when its brought to light, i see a king on a borrowed throne right now, the violence taking over this time, regimes are changing in my mind 
im so sorry, my old friend, im leaving you tonight so caught in this moment, the last breath of your life

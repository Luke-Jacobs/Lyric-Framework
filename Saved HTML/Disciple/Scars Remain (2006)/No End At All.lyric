 
like a moon that tries to hide away but the dawn will catch it with the day like an angry son thats moving on but he will never forget his home 
feel this grace shining in theres nowhere that youve not walked with me on, carried me on 
there is nowhere i can go, even in the depths of the sea youre not too far away when i wake, when i sleep you are capturing me with a love that knows no end at all like a desert that is dead and dry, but the river fills it up in time like a daughter thats been thrown away then is adopted by a kinder face

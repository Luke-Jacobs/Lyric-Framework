 
its not found in throwing roses on a grave or in the cursed bottom of a bottled plague it wasnt in the torment that will never fade but i see the truth now 
this was my hell living without you here even heaven is hell if somehow you were not there if you were not there 
it wasnt in the flames that wont stop burning or within a fire that is never quenched it wasnt in the brokenness of all my failings but i see the truth now 
lord, i need to breathe you drink you, dream you nothing ever will compare need to breathe you, drink you dream you, need you

 
what is all this? the question i am asking its not what is i feel like i was promised 
this hurts, this leaves a lasting laceration i cant believe that this is what my faith was for 
the scars remain, reminds of pain the scars remain 
when i see you, i see scars that are matching when i see you, i see scars that are matching i know what im feeling you are feeling scars remaining through when i see you, i see scars 
my feet will sink in this quicksand around me unless something or someone comes to save me

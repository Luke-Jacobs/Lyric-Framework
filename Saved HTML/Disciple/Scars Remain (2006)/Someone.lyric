 
all i see inside is a longing for something thats outside this understanding of the sun breaking open and it shines over me, shines over me 
i can see the order in the way that the oceans rise and roll out again i can see the order in the way that the flowers die to bloom again 
and i know that there is something out there watching everything i know theres something out there even if i cant see i know that there is someone out there watching over me i know theres someone out there 
silence in this night a million ballads to something far from sight with an unspoken name and my reflection, image from some other time some other time 
even though i cant see the fingerprints are everywhere

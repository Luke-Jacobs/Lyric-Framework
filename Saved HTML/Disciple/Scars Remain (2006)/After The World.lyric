 
you break the glass, try to hide your face recorded lines that just will not erase and buried in your loss of innocence you wonder if youll find it again 
was i there for the worst of all your pain? and was i there when your blue skies ran away? was i there when the rains were flooding you off your feet? those were my tears falling down for you, falling down for you 
im the one that youve been looking for im the one that youve been waiting for ive had my eyes on you ever since you were born i will love you after the rain falls down i will love you after the sun goes out ill have my eyes on you after the world is no more 
did i arrange the light of your first day? did i create the rhythm your heart makes? could you believe when your candle starts to fade? i want to be the one that you believe could take it all away, take your heart away 
isnt my life a clear sign since i have crossed over this chasm to fill the space between me and you? and i will do it all over again just look for me, just wait for me 
the one youve been looking for the one youve been waiting for you wont have to look anymore

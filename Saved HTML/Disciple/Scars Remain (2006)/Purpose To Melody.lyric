 
i remember days gone by and what it was first like to never think that it could end dont know what we were thinking and i reflect upon that night when we would breathe for the first time to see the hands raised high to the one wed give our lives 
to this day, i wouldnt change a single thing except mistakes that separate to feel again the reason in what we give the part the role in which we live 
i feel like something busting breaking out of its own skin i feel this child escaping outside of the heart of an old man i feel like something ripping and tearing off this callous revealing me i never want it to end this old feeling were feeling again 
through seasons of it all, there were deserts that would fall and there were peaks that we would climb but in the valleys where we shined we couldnt dream a better dream the almighty call our name and do something with nothing and i give purpose to this melody

 
sometimes, it gets hard upon this beaten road sometimes, i am tempted just to walk alone 
but i hear your words out of my mouth wanting, expecting that the seeds that ive sown this time ill reap in a short while 
ill run and not grow weak walk and will not faint climb the highest mountain to dive off and ill fly high on ill fly high on broken wings 
all i desire is everything that you are strength is renewed as i wait on you, god

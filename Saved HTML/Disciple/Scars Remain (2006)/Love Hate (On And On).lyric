 
a little one thats full of innocence he doesnt know that somethings out of place another one dreams murder all night hes been living full of hatred all his life 
well, i guess its always been this way a world thats full of love and hate oh god, but will it stay this way? so much love, so much hate 
it goes on and on and on around and again 
a mother is willing to give her life while another one throws away her child a son stands and he turns the other cheek while another one spits in a face while it bleeds 
this evil thats within is hiding in our skin what are we? when will we? why are we still wondering? 
oh jesus, i cant take the hate anymore save us from ourselves before we go on and on and on around and again

 
i feel you
your sun it shines
i feel you
within my mind
you take me there
you take me where
the kingdom comes
you take me to
and lead me through
babylon
this is the morning of our love
its just the dawning of our love
i feel you
your heart it sings
i feel you
the joy it brings
where heaven waits
those golden gates
and back again
you take me to
and lead me through
oblivion
this is the morning of our love
its just the dawning of our love
i feel you
your precious soul
and i am whole
i feel you
your rising sun
thy kingdom come
i feel you
each move you make
i feel you
each breath you take
where angels sing
and spread their wings
my loves on high
you take me home
to glorys throne
by and by
this is the morning of our love
its just the dawning of our love

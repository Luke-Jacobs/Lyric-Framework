 
revisit over and over in your mind
bitterness the root that feeds the poisoned lie
replaying what would you do if you could
repayment for all the hurt they caused you

pain is not pain unless you breed it like you do
pain will be pain until you learn to let it go

meditate, would i be happy if you died
recreate a thousand deaths to make me smile
suffocate the good intentions left inside
desecrate all that is holy in my life

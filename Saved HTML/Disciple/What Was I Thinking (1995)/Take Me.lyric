 
lying stagnant, lost, but found never gaining enough ground
salvation from prayer on my knees but i cant take the monotony 

where else could i go to the one that i know i need to go farther if its no bother

take me higher 

step by step, just lead me on the path that ive been on so long
show me ways that i can grow cause i need to be so close

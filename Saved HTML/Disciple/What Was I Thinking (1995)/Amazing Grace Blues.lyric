 
amazing grace, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me.
i was so lost, but now im found.
i was blind, but now i see.

when weve been there for ten thousand years,
bright shining as, as the sun,
weve no less days to sing my gods praise
than when we first begun.

yeah!



it was amazing grace, how sweet the sound

yeah, yeah, yeah!

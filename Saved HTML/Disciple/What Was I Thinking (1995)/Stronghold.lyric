 
alone again behind the locked door youre not going out to face the world anymore lost inside the loneliness again youre wondering where true love has been 
hiding behind the counterfeit mask youre thinking of how the happiness wont last the emptiness has filled the life inside hoping that there is a guiding light

 oh jesus, theres nothing he wont do hell take the pain away to help you through oh jesus, can take you from the cold his love is the worlds stronghold 
knowing the truth is waiting in the dark youre trying to hide the scars from the worlds mark on your knees asking once again oh hes looking down ready to come in

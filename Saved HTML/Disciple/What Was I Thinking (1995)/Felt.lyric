 
my soul finds rest in god alone he is my rock, my salvation, my fortress, ill never be shaken my hope comes from him 
you are my god my soul thirsts for you in a land where theres no water your loves better than my life and i will praise you as long as i live

 its not who i am but who lives inside of me that gives me power to stand and the faith to believe that i can walk in the fire and lay my back on the nails hang myself on my cross and feel what he felt 
i feel 
in your name i lift my hands with singing lips my mouth will praise you on my bed i remember you i think of you all night my soul clings to you, youre my help your right hand upholds me they who seek my life will be destroyed, become food for dogs while i rejoice in god

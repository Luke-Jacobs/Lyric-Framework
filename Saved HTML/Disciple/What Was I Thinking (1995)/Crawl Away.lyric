 
burn a candle by my bed, sleep wont visit me tonight images inside my head dont reflect the light inside deceiver whispers my name, tries to crawl up by my side lord deliver me, dont leave me alone tonight

 it is he whos in me thats greater than he thats in the world the struggles not with me, the battle belongs to the lord

 crawl away, i confess that im less than a righteous man you accuse, he forgives, as i live in a wanderers land crawl away, i confess that im less than a righteous man crawl away 
try to make me fall only builds my faith in christ my knee hits the ground, reveals the secret i cant hide 
took the life from you, took the keys right from your hands try to compare him, but you are subject to the lamb

 
the sky grows black as the earth stands still
and clouds roll back when the son is revealed



i see jesus, coming in the eastern sky to bring his children home
i see jesus, coming in the eastern sky im going home.

cars collide and people die, planes fall from the sky
the graves begin to split and seas open wide

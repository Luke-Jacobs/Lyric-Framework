 
like a single grain of sand moving with the tide no one knows im here wouldnt matter if i died out of control lost on my way searching and dying more each day

 trying as hard as i can wont someone hold out their hand i feel so strange in this land but if you ask me im fine

 i cant go on ive always had to be by myself im so alone i just need somebodys help  
time is running out tired of not having rest cant go on like this forever maybe death is best tell me what its all about, you love me, well that i really doubt 
told me a story of a man with scars in his feet and hands can take me away from this land but can he really save me

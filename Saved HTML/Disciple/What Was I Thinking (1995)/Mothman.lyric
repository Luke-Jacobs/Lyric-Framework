 
the thorns crush my spine send them to the swine i choke the pleasure and i drown in dust all my cares are bones of rust

 wash me, cleanse me, heal me, make me a mothman wash me, cleanse me, heal me, make me a man 
touch your garments just for fun i am a match unto the sun i want to fly into your light i want to fly into your light

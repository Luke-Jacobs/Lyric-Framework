 
i see the empty heart i feel the bondage chain i touch the loneliness i know the truth of pain its not always what it seems to be i never thought theyd get a hold of me 

 
unanswered questions, a faithless prayer, am i really asking, or am i just too scared to give away the only thing that separates your love from me, help me take my beam away to where i know that i can see... 
i hate the evil sin i know what lies within sometimes i think that i could never change, hold on to a world that seems so strange

 
one drop of blood is all it takes to take my sin away and make me whole again

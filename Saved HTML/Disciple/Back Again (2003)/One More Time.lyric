 
another night i sit alone another night i my heart is so heavy i cant believe that its beating on its own i know you tell me to be glad when trials come to me but instead i always question if you love me at all 
but i know you know me jesus i know you listen to my cry i need you to come inside 
and i will praise and give you thanks for you have lifted me to carry me one more time i will praise and give you thanks for you have lifted me to make me see my life is in your hands 
seems like the ones i love the most when i am needing their affection theyre never there and im left all alone i know you tell me to be glad when trials come to me but instead i always question if you love me at all 
but i know you know me jesus i know you hear this prodigals cry father run to me tonight

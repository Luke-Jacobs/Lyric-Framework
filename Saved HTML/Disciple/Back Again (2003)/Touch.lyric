 
i would do anything to see him cause i know he is passing by wont let my situation hinder so desperate im willing to climb 
aint gonna let it slow me down ill fight my way through the crowd and then i heard him say, "ill enter in your house today ive come to seek and save that which was lost" 
jesus i need you, jesus i want you ive got to break through so i can see you 
oh how i cant stop the bleeding spent all my money and no one can help if i could touch the hem of his garment i know its through him that i can be made well 
aint gonna let it slow me down ill fight my way through the crowd and then i heard him say, "who touched me, powers gone from me daughter your faith has made you well" 
jesus i need you, jesus i want you ive got to break through so i can touch you 
aint gonna let it slow me down ill fight my way through the crowd and then i heard him say, "enter in my good servant i will be yours and you will be mine"

 
remain in me, dont sever me dont spit me out call on me and walk me to your way my lips arent sealed 
some will say this and then some will say that i really dont know just where you are at if the truth be told, youre just getting to old moving way too fast, and getting to cold 
you say that i should just give up you say why dont you just shut up 
youll never shut me up forgive me if i should lose my way dont cut me off cause i choose you in my life today even if they hate me

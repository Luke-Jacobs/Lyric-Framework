 
have you ever, ever crossed your heart, ever hoped to die have you ever, ever fell apart, ever told a lie have you ever, ever spilled a crumb, ever doubted tom have you ever, pulled out your thumb, let the course run 
chastise, baptize, belt-feed, bring me your face 
you are holy, almighty, you are worthy, lord you own me, bring me your face 
have you ever, ever had the faith, ever really prayed have you ever had a thrill, ever got your fill have you ever, ever shut it out, ever lost your doubt have you ever, pulled out your thumb, let the course run

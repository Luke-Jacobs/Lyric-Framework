 
i could never turn back from where you brought me from i am not where i should be, but im better than where i was why did you show grace that was so undeserving i may never know but i will give you everything 
until my dying breath i breathe 
remembering the first time i gave my life to you in the sea of forgetfulness, you through my sin into touched me with your healing hands and you stole my heart away 
i was still a sinner when you gave your life for me while i cursed your name you stretched your hand out to rescue me wiped my sin away with just one touch of your great love so i will seek your face and put my hope in what youve done

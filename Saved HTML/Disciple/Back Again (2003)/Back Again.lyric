 
looking back upon my life im very thankful that your arm is not too short to rescue and deliver me take my hand and lead me out and through through the waters of the red sea through the blood and the death of the enemy while a new foe rages and holds up an image of a man that i used to be 
throwing up my insides out on my knees before the throne staring in the porcelain dome that flushes away all the high of last nights waste and i will never forget the bad taste that was left inside my mouth of when she left when i cried, when i died, no i aint going aint goin back again! aint goin back again! 
once i wasted, now ive tasted a better life more than ive ever known once i wasted, now ive tasted a better life more than ive ever known once i hated, now embraced it a better life more than ive known 
and im glad that the past is gone, 
that im never gonna be alone cause i found true love even though that my number three finger is empty and theres nothing id give in exchange for a love that strange from when she left when i cried when i died, no aint going back again! aint going back agan! 
once i wasted, now ive tasted a better life more than ive ever known once i wasted, now ive tasted a better life more than ive ever known once i hated, now embraced it a better life more than ive known 
more than ive known once i wasted, now ive tasted a better life more than ive ever known once i hated, now embraced it a better life more than ive known

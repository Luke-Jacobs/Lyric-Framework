 
when the wicked come against me to take my life, eat my flesh, cut me down, break my bones, leave me dead when the troubles all around me he will hide me inside, the secret place where his face, i will seek 
if you are for me who can be against me ill not fear the one, not fear the one, whod take my life, take it with his hands 
when the enemys around me i wont run, i will stand, confident, hes with me, im in his hand when the flood rises against me, youre my rock, fortress, deliver, advocate, my defense

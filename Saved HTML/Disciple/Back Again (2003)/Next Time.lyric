 
the spirit of the sovereign lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor sent me to heal the brokenhearted bring freedom to the captives bring sight to the blind break the chains of the oppressed for this is the year of the lord 
today this scripture if fulfilled in your ears but i know you wont believe and you refuse to see physician heal yourself one day youll say to me while the god you claim to serve will be the god you hang on a tree 
the first time that he came they ripped his beard and beat his back up but the next time that he comes hell have a flaming sword with eyes of fire the first time that he came they pierced his hands and his feet and hung him up but the next time that he comes hell be on a white horse and ill be with him 
oh how i longed to take you under my wing and hide you in the shadow of my love all day long my arms have been open but you would not come to me, but you would not come to me 
i was like a lamb led to the slaughter and i did not speak a thing as you insulted me there will come a day when the word of god will come down and i will strike the nations and consume them with the breath of my mouth

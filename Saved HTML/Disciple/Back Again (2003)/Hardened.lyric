 
dont want to hear it anymore same old stuff ive heard before whats the point in serving god im so glad you asked 
if your mother had cancer or someone raped your sister or you die in disaster tell me who do you turn to now 
could you help yourself could you save yourself who do you turn to now 
jesus, god break us, god change us, for we are a people of hardened hearts and unclean lips 
dont want to be scared to believe fire of hell ill never see its all just a fairy tale well i hope youre right and im wrong 
separated forever from the hand of a savior theres no one to help you there tell me who do you turn to now

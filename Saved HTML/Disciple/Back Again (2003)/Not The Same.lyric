 
how can you be of god? when you look, when you dress, when you smell just like the world do you see me as being bad, a friend your children shouldnt have, just one glance and you know what im about 
its not the length of my hair, its not the clothes that i wear but its the cross that i bear cause you know that i am 
in the world not of it cause we gotta show the world he loves them even though we look the same were not the same 
god where can i look for you? what will it look like, what will it be like when i gaze my eyes on you will i find you a hungry man, will i find you in a prison, or will i find you in the office of a church?

 
its buried deep with in the past, i hope it doesnt last its something i already chase, i already chase i try to give it all away, but its never gonna fade its something i dont wanna face, i dont wanna face i know you feel its all the same, but i promise thatll change its something i already chase, i already chase you know im trying to believe that youre never gonna leave its something i dont wanna face, i dont wanna face 
theres nothing left! the fear is gone! 
when my heartstrings come undone i will wait for you, i will pray for you before i make my final run i will stay with you, decay with you 
i know im not the perfect one, this pain has just begun its something i already chase, i already chase you bring me to a better path, its everything i asked its something i dont wanna face, i dont wanna face 
theres nothing left! the fear is gone! theres nothing left! the fear is gone! 
and when my heartstrings come undone i will wait for you, i will pray for you before i make my final run i will stay with you, decay with you 
if you fade out without me, youll know all about me if you fade out without me, youll know all... 
and when my heartstrings come undone i will wait for you, i will pray for you before i make my final run i will stay with you, decay with you and when my heartstrings come undone i will wait for you, i will pray for you before i make my final run i will stay with you, decay with you

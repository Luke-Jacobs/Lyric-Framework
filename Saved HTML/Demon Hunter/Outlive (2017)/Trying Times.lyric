 
these are trying times
made to break the heart wide
but we still defy
we will make the dead rise

we cant be silent
we cant belong
we have a promise
to die upon
well set the fire
into a song
to burn eternal
when were all gone

these are trying times
made to break the heart wide
but we still defy
we will make the dead rise
we will make the dead rise

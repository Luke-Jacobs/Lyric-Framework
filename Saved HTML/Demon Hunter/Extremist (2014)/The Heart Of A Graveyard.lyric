 
everything in time
set your eyes upon the shallow surface
hollow out your mind
how divine, you disengage your self

tell me
tell me of your consolation
tell me
i am lost in the gray
tell me that your final home is not a
a shot in the dark
tell me that your hopes and dreams dont end in the heart

of a graveyard

set aside your soul
let tomorrow realize itself





brace for the ending
you may not see
will you stop descending
six shallow feet

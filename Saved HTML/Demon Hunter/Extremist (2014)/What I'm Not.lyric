 
time is wearing down my fight
my determination
dividing in my head
this degeneration cull
its my definiton
recalling all i am
where i begin

i could live my life for the void inside
to the vacant rise surrender mine
forever divide

but i know
how the rest will go
and the line
that i live behind
never hide
never compromise
like them
everything i am
is what im not

in my revelation
i can see it all clear
my enemy, my guide
every idol i refuse
every declaration
becoming all i am
to my end

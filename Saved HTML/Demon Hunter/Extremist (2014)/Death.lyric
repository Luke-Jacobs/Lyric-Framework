 
im not your gateway
im not your prodigal son
i am the vile lesser-than
just who do you think i am?

im not your standard
im not your vision divine
i am no sacrificial lamb
just who do you think i am?

i am death 

im not your sacrifice
im not your shelter in the storm
i am determinately man
just who do you think i am?

im not your child
im not your paragon of just
i am by other means damned
just who do you think i am?



i am death 
who do you think i am?

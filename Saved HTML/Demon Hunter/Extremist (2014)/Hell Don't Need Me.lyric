 
i dont wanna close my eyes
i cant tell if im asleep or if im blind

were going nowhere
no one seems to care

i could sell a peace of mind
i could tell you every time that i divide

the water will decide
where to feed me
mother dont you cry
hell dont need me

i will see it all in timei cant be the only one across that line

were going nowhere
no one seems to care



dont need me

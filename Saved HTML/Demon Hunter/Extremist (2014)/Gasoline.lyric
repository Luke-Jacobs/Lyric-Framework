 
i thought about you
i thought about the ones that i forget
oh please forgive me
i hope that ive not pushed you to the edge

let me wash away the painful words i wrote
we can smother out the flames within my soul
no more standing by the way that i believe
we can smother out the flames

with gasoline

you break around me
you say that i should give my heart a rest





well watch these flames
like a tower of dissent, choking out regret
devouring light
an image of my soul, out of our control

 
trapped behind my state of mind, i took your words and now im blind. and everything youve given just kills me. your words swarm me through my soul like locusts. eating away at any glimpse of focus. their eyes flaming red like pain. filling the void once righteous and bloodstained. but words cant kill the light inside me that tears me from the hate that binds me. i feel it crawling up my spine. but ill cut it off before it reaches the bloodline. youll never fade me out, youll never turn me off. youll never reach the end, youll never hear enough. youre half-grasp cant exterminate my stand. you cant rule with a broken upper hand. a fragment of whats been left behind. trapped behind my state of mind, i took your words and now im blind. and everything youve given just kills me. your face brings out the hate that rots me. the face of everyday that haunts me. i cant pull away my blank stare. a thousand times should prove i dont care. but hands cant steal the light that makes me. or bring me to the fate that breaks me i feel it crawling up my spine. but ill cut it off before it reaches the bloodline. youll never fade me out, youll never turn me off. youll never reach the end, youll never hear enough. youre the half-grasp cant exterminate my stand. you cant rule with a broken upper hand. a fragment of whats been left behind. trapped behind my state of mind, i took your words and now im blind. and everything youve given just kills me.

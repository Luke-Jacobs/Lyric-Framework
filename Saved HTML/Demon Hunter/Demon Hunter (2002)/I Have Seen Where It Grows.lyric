 
a shell for the earth, all seasons reverse. a life inside out in a jet-black hearse. the feel of pain and the taste of dirt. a dardened sky and the loss of worth. lower me down under glorious green. eternity waits on a broken machine. exit the soul in a vibrant white. leaving the shell in the dead of night. life is a path, death a destination. ive met the end of being, my eyes are open wide. i feel myself depleting, and watch my body die. a step to the throne, i stand alone. a vacant mind and a destined home. engaging the end in a seamless gaze. like blind i climb through the tortured blaze. raise me up into white unstained eternity gained, only life remains. forever the scars have been washed away like blood on the brow of a forgotten day. life is a path, death a destination. ive met the end of being, my eyes are open wide. i feel myself depleting, and watch my body die. life is a path, death a destination

 
i hold you in like a deep breath. feel you like the last beautiful touch before a final rest. i know ill see you forever. i want it painted black and red. its so beautiful to me, its everything i see. its so beautiful to me, but its nothing that i need. and i cant taste anything less. every time im forced down. to be with yourself, take all the blood you want. but not from here. its so beautiful to me, it is everything i see. its so beautiful to me, but its nothing that i need. not a hand, not a finger. this is my home. im dying here. i hide in the corner. that look on your face, im accustomed to it.

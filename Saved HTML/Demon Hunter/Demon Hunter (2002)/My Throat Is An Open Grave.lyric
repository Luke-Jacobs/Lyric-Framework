 
we lay face down in pale solitude. to save face, we pulled our walls in front of you. to the same place where we danced in front of you. we fell from grace and watched the hopefall from your face. this isnt me i used to say. all the love was so gone. it feels good to be alive. ive been dead for so long: and all the broken promises. i cant face. afraid if someone notices, i lose my place. fractured, broken, paralyzed. i need some space, tear me open, analyze. this isnt me i used to say. all the love was so gone. it feels good to be alive. ive been dead for so long. wake up screaming, im awake and dreaming, and i wont stop breathing until my heart stops beating. this isnt me, i used to say. all the love was so gone, it feels good to be alive, ive been dead for so long

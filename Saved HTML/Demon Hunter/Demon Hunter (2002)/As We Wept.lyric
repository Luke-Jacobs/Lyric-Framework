 
i will stand and fight to justify you. you have bled and died to justify me. force me down into hate. your freedom will stop when i cant breath. im taking the path that i dont need. im taking the place so it wont bleed. broken out and turned away. burned to the ground and change the face. bled to death and turned to gray. resurrect again to say. i made my promise, and now ive fallen. through broken pieces i set you. i will stand and fight to justify you. you have bled and died to justify me. let me see it all die in front of myself so i cant lie. a hollow design for the new side. exterior death for the old side. this is the end of the last time. bury the old and say the name. break the mold and new remain. resurrect again to say. i made my promise, and now ive fallen. through broken pieces i see you. i will stand and fight to justify you. you have bled and died to justify me. a lifeless body, a broken soul. i fall to zero, ive lost control. ive lost control, i will stand and fight to justify you. you have bled and died to justify me.

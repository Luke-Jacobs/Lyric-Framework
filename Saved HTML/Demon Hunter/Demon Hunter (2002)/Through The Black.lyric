 
ive never been the type to turn my back and run. its just never appealed to me to be the same as everyone. and when it comes to shove and i cant see you through the black, im going to scream your name till you come back. and every time i play with fire, im going to burn, burn, burn until i learn. and everytime i do it myself, im going to hate, hate, hate. its time to get it straight. i bury sick side, i tear from the inside out, i follow the downside, im waiting for something else. i know that youll be here and ill be waiting. i know that youll be near and ill be waiting. i turn it back and question everything in site. its like i try to fall again when everything is going right. and everything that matters isnt everything in site. its taking every bit of me to keep this all inside. ive never been the type to turn my back and run. its just never appealed to me to be the same as everyone. and when it comes to shove, and i cant see you through the black, im going to scream your name till you come back. i bury sick side, i tear from the inside out, i follow the downside, im waiting for something else. i know that youll be here and ill be waiting. i know that youll be near and ill be waiting. lost my mind and ive lost track, gonna scream your name till you come back. scream your name, lost my mind i know that youll be here and ill be waiting. i know that youll be near and ill be waiting. lost my mind, ill be waiting. ill scream your name til you come back

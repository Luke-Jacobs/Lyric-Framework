 
nothing breeds more contempt for this world than memories now formed every moment a new seed is grown to no reason, the trouble unfolds for the trials of today im no jury, really dont care how you feel the pleasant notion of miraculous change drifts into multiple jeers

 you want the good life you break your back you snap your fingers, you snap your neck 
seconds drip through my hands washed of moments unborn all the spaces between bleed a tribute to a sacrament never exposed a message to the forces, ive no pity, dont know how thankful to feel expectations of my daily bread gives me the hunger to steal

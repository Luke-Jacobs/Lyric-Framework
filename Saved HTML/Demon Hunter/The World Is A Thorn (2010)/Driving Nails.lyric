 
i was the light i was the quiet heart i was the place we used to dwell. and when the cold would tear your life apart, i was the warmth that you had felt 
what have i become? thoughts like shadows swelling through my mind. what have i become? something else inside... 
is driving nails into my soul angels from my door. driving nails into my soul something inside.... 
i was the blood inside your broken heart i was the stone that you had held 
i close my eyes search for you retracing every step.

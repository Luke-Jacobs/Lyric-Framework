 
i, i see the weight of hollow death residing in you take now your final breath exhale the truth i see the fear of nothing left dead fragments of youth you hold it in yourself i feel it too 
i mourn your blindness i die along and swallow darkness in misery is where i belong 
collapsing in on yourself i dont know why i try i try collapsing in on yourself i dont know why you deny 
i, i know the light is burning dim and dying in you i know the pain that lies within i feel it too 
i mourn your blindness i die along and swallow darkness in misery is where i belong 
collapsing in on yourself i dont know why i try i try collapsing in on yourself i dont know why you deny 
collapsing in on yourself i dont know why i try i try collapsing in on yourself i dont know why you deny 
collapsing in on yourself i dont know why i try i try collapsing in on yourself i dont know why you deny

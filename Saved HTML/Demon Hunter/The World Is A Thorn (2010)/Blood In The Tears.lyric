 
dont come on quietly when you draw near dont go on lightly dont leave me here i wither quickly in winters cold, but carry onward like i was told. 
and i wait for a sign 
like blood in the tears of all my enemies so they will see knowing the pain the way they should like blood in the tears of all my enemies given to me leaving a trail to where you stood 
and when its quiet when you can hear i beg you to take me away from here 
cleansing red wake the dead

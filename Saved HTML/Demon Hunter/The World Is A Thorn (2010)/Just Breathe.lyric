 
so now you try, but the blade is primed to just cut you down again. to no avail, this fix divine was wrought to do you in 
seemingly endless, beckoning debt vacant and nameless, where is the end? 
aching just to endure again sweet loss able again to feel this is real. 
just breathe suffer again look back stand in the wake and breathe wait for the end fight back this isnt over. 
one single touch will further crush your corrupted state of mind. you carve the way for regret to take you further down the line 
this isnt over.

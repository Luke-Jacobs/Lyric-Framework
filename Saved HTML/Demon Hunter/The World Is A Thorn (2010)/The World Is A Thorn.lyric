 
the gavel has fallen, along with the rest. are we expected to settle for this? bring us the plague, lead us away. blacken tomorrow with ash of today. cant you see the fabric of our standards wearing thin? see your world in its grave at the hands of the enslaved. 
wont bow to man. wont bow to government. wont trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust. wont love a world where my god is mocked. i defy. 
oh, a kiss on the serpents head. we walk in the line of deceit, the walking dead. cant you feel the ground of our discretion giving way? refusal of hope, solution demise. bury the truth in a mountain of lies. 
wont bow to man. wont bow to government. wont trust in a failed system of self-fulfilling lust. wont love a world where my god is mocked. i defy. 
this is what you try to sell me. subjective nothingness. pull your sickness from my throat. let me breathe the truth. let me breathe the truth. 
wont bow to man. wont bow to government. wont bow to greed. wont bow to false hope. wont bow to self. wont bow to modern code. wont sell my soul to a dead world. i defy.

 
born from the fire clean, crawling through the dirt like war
5 years, my mother gave a voice for war
10, i was dead, born again with eyes for war
by 15, hate was the name of my war

wash me in the river
give me to the pain of lifewar
lifewar

20 years gone, and father told me life was like war
hands to the bone, 25 years of war
30, i wake to the sound of souls at war
i will pass through, buried with the flag of my war

wash me in the river
give me to the pain of lifewar
lifewar

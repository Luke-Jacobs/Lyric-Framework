 
this is our call: to see these idols fall drag them out into the light let fate devour whole this is your fault you fool of faith untrue that we should face the grave with such a blackened view. 
oh, this pain is true we see the damage done in the eyes of those, turning away 
save your plea for the day that we suffer the wake of this treason. rain like fire descending upon us in holy resolve upon this ground. 
hollow name of fiive encircled frame deception incarnate: receive my vow of hate. 
oh, this pain is true see how the blood will run into the eyes of those, turning away 
we see the damage done resounding desecration we see the damage done blackened insurrection 
suppress the pain of mind as long as you can bear and feel the desperation clawing from within. they say the truth is found when hell is at your doorstep. youd better pray to see that time come to pass.

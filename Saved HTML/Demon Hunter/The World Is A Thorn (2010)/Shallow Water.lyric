 
remeber the threat from which it was said: "you will reap every seed that you sow." and the tomb where you lay is the bed that you made be still in the pain that you wrote. see now, every scar is a choice you make every choice is a vow you take take pity upon your fate, you coward! 
sleepwalk through heavens call, no forest for the trees. unlearn every step you take, itll bring you to your knees. tread... 
shallow water safe from the weight, the burden of sacrifice sons and daughters, pray for the rain may it redeem their eyes. 
and now we have seen what complacency brings as the blind are assuming the lead. dig deep in the hole where you buried your soul, in the river from where it bleeds. 
take now your eternal stand before it pulls you in.

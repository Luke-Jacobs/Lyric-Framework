 
rebellion oh, cheap thrill sand vacant youth carry out your own will shovel deep and bury truth social stain, punk wreck, mothers own defect sing that song you know so well sing it one foot in hell eyes wide black turn your back oh, how the foolish will see how every man he will bleed 
the vultures circle, halo of the dead another vicious cycle, swall what youre fed and now the vultures circle, halo of the dead another vicious cycle be true to your dissent. 
somehow feel as though you could somehow, in all your petty suffering burn this down 
rejection of weak trends and fake hate this is what youre fighting for? some fools mistake i will devour you ill overpower you rise from the ashes, screaming eternity 
ignite upon these words and breathe defeat your shallow deeds make hell for wood and stone, flesh and bone, this alone

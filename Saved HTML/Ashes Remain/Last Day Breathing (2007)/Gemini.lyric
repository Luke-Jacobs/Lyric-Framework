 
the tainted air has risen above the clouds of trust
rain down upon these eyes and turn them to rust
she cries into the sunlight and screams of love
she thinks shes lost
while he stands at the river and just cant get across

and all this time
and all this time

its just the rusted trust of the gemini
and in her mind shes screaming

wont you look at me
wont you set me free
wont you pull these lies out
ive got no doubt

open the box of worms however painful it may be 
scream into the air and cry until its never the same

and all this time
and all this time

its just the rusted trust of the gemini
and in her mind shes never

wont you look at me
wont you set me free
wont you pull these lies out
ive got no doubt



wont you look at me
wont you set me free
wont you pull these lies out
ive got no doubt

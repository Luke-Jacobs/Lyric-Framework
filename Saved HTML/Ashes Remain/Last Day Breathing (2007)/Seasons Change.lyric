 
i see the stars
i know
i hear the call
its closing time
i sit and watch the seasons change
i watch them from my window payne
i wonder when and where i will go
and with who i dont know
i dont know what to do or say
all i want is for someone to come and take me away
you see the tears you think ive cried
and find your fears arent justified
the pain i feel not on display
an old excuse, just one of those days
now i know you are here
now i know im not alone inside

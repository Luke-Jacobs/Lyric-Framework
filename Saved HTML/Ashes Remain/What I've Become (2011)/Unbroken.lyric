 
shut down tell me theres gotta be
a way out from underneath the gravity
my heart is breaking down
i cant shut out and silence the confusion
spun around and lost in the illusion
my mind is breaking now


ill walk through the fire
just to feel you next to me
hold on to desire
youre the only hope i see
i hate what i have been
falling apart within
dying to be unbroken

lost in a broken generation
desperate for a revelation
these walls are coming down
